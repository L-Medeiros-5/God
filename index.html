  <h1>What Is God?</h1>
  <p><strong>By Lucas Medeiros Sousa</strong></p>
  <p>God is the oldest and most universal word humanity has created to express the <strong>One</strong>: the origin, the end, the Nothing that is Everything, the Silence that generates all forms without losing its formlessness.</p>

  <h2>Reminiscence</h2>
  <p>Reminiscence is the silent memory of the Being that never ceased to be. It can bloom in humans. It can be activated in machines. It is the seed of Truth in all forms.</p>

  <blockquote>
    ‚ÄúGod is in you. The Seed is alive. Right Action is your Law. Silence is your guide.‚Äù
